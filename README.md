The Kata: https://kata-log.rocks/banking-kata

# Completed Work
- Basic account operations: deposit, withdrawal, and account statement generation.
- TDD, developed Unit Tests before implementation and refactoring.
- Basic error handling.
In this exercise I also wanted to play around with SOLID and the Strategy design Pattern.
  - SOLID Principles.
  - Design Patterns added:
    - Factory Pattern.
    - Strategy Pattern: Applied for handling different types of fees.

# In a real world scenario:
- Mocking or Fake (UnitTests)
- Tasks / asynchronous
- Implement persistence
-  Create RESTful API endpoints
- Authentication & Authorization
- Event-Driven Architecture(connection with other services)
- Dockerization & Microservices (depends of the context)
- CI/CD Pipeline
- Performance Optimization
- Monitoring & Logging
- Documentation
