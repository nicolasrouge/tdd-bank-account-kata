# TDD Banking Kata + SOLID + Design Patterns

The Kata: https://kata-log.rocks/banking-kata

# Completed Work
- Basic account operations: deposit, withdrawal, and account statement generation.
- TDD, developed Unit Tests before implementation and refactoring.
- Basic error handling.
### SOLID Principles followed:
- Single Responsibility.
- Open/Closed: Enabled.
- (to be improved) Liskov Substitution & Interface Segregation.
### Design Patterns added:
- Factory Pattern: Utilized for creating instances of different transaction types.
- Strategy Pattern: Applied for handling different types of transactions (DepositTransaction, WithdrawTransaction).
- Dependency Injection.

# In a real world scenario:
- Tasks / asynchronous
- Implement persistence
-  Create RESTful API endpoints
- Authentication & Authorization
- Event-Driven Architecture(connection with other services)
- Dockerization & Microservices (depends of the context)
- CI/CD Pipeline
- Performance Optimization
- Monitoring & Logging
- Documentation
